# Notes
Data Buffer will be hard-coded in the firmware by:

* machine protection
* PLC

14Hz is always ON. The cycle fiducial mark and the first event within the sequence.

# TODO
* Event mapping for each mode (for the Logic App)
* 1Hz beam operation means that which events always exist in the 1Hz beam? ION_ST/END?
* Constant base time shift for each event code.
